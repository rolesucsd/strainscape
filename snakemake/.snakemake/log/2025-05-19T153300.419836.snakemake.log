Lints for snakefile /ddn_scratch/roles/strain_analysis/iHMP/strainscape/snakemake/Snakefile:
    * Mixed rules and functions in same snakefile.:
      Small one-liner functions used only once should be defined as lambda
      expressions. Other functions should be collected in a common module, e.g.
      'rules/common.smk'. This makes the workflow steps more readable.

Lints for rule debug (line 63, /ddn_scratch/roles/strain_analysis/iHMP/strainscape/snakemake/Snakefile):
    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In
      distributed environments, this means that errors are harder to discover.
      In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become
      unreadable.
