Lints for snakefile /ddn_scratch/roles/strain_analysis/iHMP/strainscape/snakemake/Snakefile:
    * Mixed rules and functions in same snakefile.:
      Small one-liner functions used only once should be defined as lambda
      expressions. Other functions should be collected in a common module, e.g.
      'rules/common.smk'. This makes the workflow steps more readable.

Lints for rule megahit_coassembly (line 18, /ddn_scratch/roles/strain_analysis/iHMP/strainscape/snakemake/rules/assembly.smk):
    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In
      distributed environments, this means that errors are harder to discover.
      In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become
      unreadable.

    * Param outdir is a prefix of input or output file but hardcoded:
      If this is meant to represent a file path prefix, it will fail when
      running workflow in environments without a shared filesystem. Instead,
      provide a function that infers the appropriate prefix from the input or
      output file, e.g.: lambda w, input: os.path.splitext(input[0])[0]

    * Migrate long run directives into scripts or notebooks:
      Long run directives hamper workflow readability. Use the script or
      notebook directive instead. Note that the script or notebook directive
      does not involve boilerplate. Similar to run, you will have direct access
      to params, input, output, and wildcards.Only use the run directive for a
      handful of lines.
